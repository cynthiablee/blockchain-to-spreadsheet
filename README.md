WHAT: 
This is a Chrome browser extension that can help readers contextualize news stories with hype about blockchain technology, by reminding you that blockchain is, in essense, a giant Excel spreadsheet.

WHY:
For fun.

HOW:
To install this extension in your Chrome browser, follow these easy steps! 

1. Download this git repository to your computer by clicking "Clone or Download" and then "Download ZIP." 
2. Unzip/extract the ZIP on your computer.
3. Go to this URL in your Chrome browser: [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
4. Click to check the box for "Developer mode."
5. One of the new buttons that should appear is "Load unpacked extension." Click it. 
6. Choose the folder that the unzipped/extracted files are in (probably called "blockchain-to-spreadsheet-master").
7. The extension should now appear and the "Enabled" box should be checked. Start browsing blockchain news to read about all the things a giant Excel spreadsheet can do!

Special thanks:

Twitter user @mims (Christopher Mims) for [the suggestion](https://twitter.com/mims/status/968967786130300928) to make a "browser extension that replaces "blockchain" with "mulitple copies of a giant Excel spreadsheet." For example, "multiple copies of a giant excel spreadsheet to revolutionize journalism." 

Thanks to Tom Maxwell for the [tutorial and template code](https://9to5google.com/2015/06/14/how-to-make-a-chrome-extensions/) for this project! 

Enjoy!
